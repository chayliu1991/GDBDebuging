# 信息

## 查看 gdb 的版本信息

直接使用：

```
gdb version
```

或者启动 gdb 之后：

```
(gdb) show version
```

## 启动 gdb 时不显示信息

启动时使用：

```
gdb -q
```

可以直接在 `~/.bashrc` 中，为 gdb 设置一个别名：

```
alias gdb="gdb -q"
```

### 查看命令分类

help 不加参数时会得到命令的分类：

```
(gdb) help
List of classes of commands:

aliases -- Aliases of other commands
breakpoints -- Making program stop at certain points
data -- Examining data
files -- Specifying and examining files
internals -- Maintenance commands
obscure -- Obscure features
running -- Running the program
stack -- Examining the stack
status -- Status inquiries
support -- Support facilities
tracepoints -- Tracing of program execution without stopping the program
user-defined -- User-defined commands

Type "help" followed by a class name for a list of commands in that class.
Type "help all" for the list of all commands.
Type "help" followed by command name for full documentation.
Type "apropos word" to search for commands related to "word".
Command name abbreviations are allowed if unambiguous.
```

### 查看具体命令用法

```
(gdb) help start
Start the debugged program stopping at the beginning of the main procedure.
You may specify arguments to give it.
Args may include "*", or "[...]"; they are expanded using the
shell that will start the program (specified by the "$SHELL" environment
variable).  Input and output redirection with ">", "<", or ">>"
are also allowed.

With no arguments, uses arguments last specified (with "run" or 
"set args").  To cancel previous arguments and run with no arguments,
use "set args" without arguments.

To start the inferior without using a shell, use "set startup-with-shell off".
```
